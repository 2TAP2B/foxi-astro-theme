# Styling in Astro

Published on: 2022-09-05

Styling your Astro project is a crucial part of the development process. In this post, we'll explore the different methods you can use to style your Astro components and pages.

## Using CSS

The most straightforward way to style your Astro project is by using CSS. You can create global stylesheets and import them into your components, or use inline styles for quick adjustments.

## CSS Modules

Astro also supports CSS Modules, which allow you to scope your styles locally to the component. This prevents style conflicts and makes your stylesheets more maintainable.

## Tailwind CSS

For those who prefer utility-first CSS frameworks, Astro integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Tailwind provides a set of predefined classes that you can use to style your components quickly and efficiently.

## Conclusion

No matter which styling method you choose, Astro provides the flexibility to use the tools and frameworks you're most comfortable with. Experiment with different approaches to find the best fit for your project.
