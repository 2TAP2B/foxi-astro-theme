## Setting Up Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes in Astro are created using square brackets in your file names. For example, to create a route that handles different blog posts, you can create a file named `[slug].astro` in your `src/pages/blog` directory.

## Fetching Data

To display dynamic content, you can fetch data based on the route parameters. In the `[slug].astro` file, you can use Astro's data fetching capabilities to load content dynamically.

## Creating Links

When linking to dynamic routes, you can use the `href` attribute with the appropriate parameters. This ensures that users can navigate to different dynamic pages seamlessly.

## Conclusion

Dynamic routes are a powerful feature in Astro that allow you to create flexible and data-driven pages. By understanding how to set them up, you can build more dynamic and interactive web applications.
