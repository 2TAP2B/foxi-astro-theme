## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is a popular platform for deploying static sites. To deploy your Astro site to Vercel, simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will handle the rest. Vercel also provides features like automatic builds and previews.

## Deploying to Netlify

Netlify is another great option for deploying Astro sites. Similar to Vercel, you can connect your GitHub repository, and Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site. It also offers powerful features like form handling and serverless functions.

## Self-Hosting

If you prefer more control over your deployment, you can self-host your Astro site. This involves building your site locally and uploading the static files to a web server. Popular options for self-hosting include DigitalOcean and AWS.

## Conclusion

Deploying your Astro site can be quick and painless with the right platform. Choose the option that best fits your needs and start sharing your site with the world.
